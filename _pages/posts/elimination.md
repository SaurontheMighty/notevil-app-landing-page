  text="Elimination is a very simple technique. We scan a row/column/house and see what numbers are missing.<br><br>Here, we can see that the numbers 1, 6 and 8 are missing in the first row of our puzzle.<br><br>But if we look at the last cell of our row, we can scan the column to see that both 1 and 8 are in the column. Therefore, the only missing number that could go in the cell of our first row is a 6!"
