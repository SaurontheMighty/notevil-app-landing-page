title: What is Not Evil about Not Evil Sudoku? 
description: Most apps particularly mobile games are crammed with ads to a degree that is decidedly evil. After one particularly frustrating experience, I took things into my own hands and made Not Evil Sudoku with the desire of having a clean, minimalist and ad-free sudoku solving experience.

{% include blog-subtitle.html title="What makes it Not Evil?" %}
One fateful afternoon, I had the sudden urge to play sudoku. Naturally, I went to the App Store and downloaded a few of the top results.

I was shocked at how terrible the user experience was in most sudoku apps. There was a banner ad at the bottom (which I could live with), a video ad every few turns (absolutely evil) and an ad after every game.

So, I did what any self-respecting programmer would do: I made one myself :)

I'm not against ads in general, but so few apps seem to be willing to do them in moderation.
