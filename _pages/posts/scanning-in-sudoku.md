The most basic technique is scanning - systematically looking for possible numbers that can go in each empty cell.

  text="Here, we can see that in the first house one of the missing numbers is a 3.<br><br>If we scan the first row, we spot a 3 in the third house!<br><br>Thus, the first blank cannot be a 3 since we can only have one 3 in each row. So, our second blank must be a 3."

  text="Scanning is not limited to rows, we can also scan columns!<br><br>Now that we filled in the 3s of the first two houses in our first column of houses, we can turn our attention to the last house.<br><br>Scanning the columns, we see that the 3 of the last house in our column must be in the first column and third row."
