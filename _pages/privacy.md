# Not Evil Sudoku Privacy Policy
Not Evil Sudoku is a mobile application(the "App") owned, operated and maintained by Ashish Selvaraj("We", "Us"). We respect your privacy. Ashish Selvaraj does not sell or rent your data to any third parties and anonymous information is only collected to improve the app and make efficient use of our scarce resources. We aim to collect as little data as possible.

Since Ashish Selvaraj is a single individual building the app in his free time, features need to be prioritized based on app usage. It isn't practical to spend a week building a feature that only a few people want. So, the app collects some anonymous information as described below.

## Data Transmitted
The data we collect is general information that is not linked to you, such as: an identifier(further details under the "Identifier" section), the locale, iOS version, number of games played, and what features were used. We aim to collect as little data as possible. Information like that helps us make decisions like: "is it worth it to drop that iOS version?" and "which languages should I try to get the app translated into". You can turn this off in Settings -> Analytics. When you turn it off we will attempt to delete all the information that was previously collected other than the identifier.

Ashish Selvaraj developed the analytics solution in-house to minimize information collection. When data is no longer needed, it shall be deleted.

## Identifier
The user identifier is NOT linked to any of the user's personal information. It is generated using Apple's "IdentifierForVendor" API. It helps us differentiate between users without collecting personal data. This id is common to all the apps on your device which are built by Ashish Selvaraj. More information on it is available in Apple's documentation.

## Changes
Ashish Selvaraj reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time. Any changes wil be posted here in a timely manner, please review it frequently to stay up-to-date. This policy is valid from April 11, 2022.
