# Not Evil Sudoku Privacy Policy
Not Evil Sudoku is a mobile application(the "App") owned, operated and maintained by Ashish Selvaraj("We", "Us"). We respect your privacy. Ashish Selvaraj does not sell or rent your data to any third parties and anonymous information is only collected to improve the app and make efficient use of our scarce resources. We aim to collect as little data as possible.

Since Ashish Selvaraj is a single individual building the app in his free time, features need to be prioritized based on app usage. It isn't practical to spend a week building a feature that only a few people want. So, the app collects some anonymous information as described below.

## Data Transmitted
The data we collect is general information that is not linked to you, such as: an identifier(further details under the "Identifier" section), the locale, iOS version, number of games played, and what features were used. We aim to collect as little data as possible. Information like that helps us make decisions like: "is it worth it to drop that iOS version?" and "which languages should I try to get the app translated into". Other information like the time taken to complete a particular puzzle is also collected so that average time to complete a game and other metrics can be calculated in aggregate. You can turn this off in Settings -> Analytics. 

Ashish Selvaraj developed the analytics solution in-house to minimize information collection. When data is no longer needed, it shall be deleted.

However, other websites or applications that are linked to inside the app that are not related to Not Evil Sudoku such as Apple's App Store, translation services and other independent groups may collect data including personal information and users of Not Evil Sudoku should read their privacy policies in order to stay informed.

## Identifier
The user identifier is NOT linked to any of the user's personal information. It is generated using Apple's "IdentifierForVendor" API. It helps us differentiate between users without collecting personal data. This id is common to all the apps on your device which are built by Ashish Selvaraj. More information on it is available in Apple's documentation.

## Changes
Ashish Selvaraj reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time. Any changes wil be posted here in a timely manner, please review it frequently to stay up-to-date. This policy is valid from April 11, 2022 and was last updated on September 4, 2022.
