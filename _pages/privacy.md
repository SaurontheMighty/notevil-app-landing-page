# Not Evil Sudoku Privacy Policy
Not Evil Sudoku the mobile application (the "App") and notevil.io (the "Website") are owned, operated and maintained by Ashish Selvaraj("We", "Us"). We respect your privacy. Ashish Selvaraj does not sell or rent your data to any third parties and anonymous information is only collected to improve the app and make efficient use of our scarce resources. We aim to collect as little data as possible.

The Not Evil Sudoku website uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare Web Analytics</a> and doesn't store or collect any other data. The rest of this privacy policy covers the Not Evil Sudoku app.

Since Ashish Selvaraj is a single individual building the app in his free time, features need to be prioritized based on app usage. It isn't practical to spend a week building a feature that only a few people want. So, the app collects some anonymous information as described below.

## Data Transmitted
The data we collect is general information that is not linked to you, such as: an identifier(further details under the "Identifier" section), the locale, iOS version, streak, app version, number of games played and time taken to solve each puzzle. While this may seem odd, note that all of this data is stored aggregately. None of the other pieces of information are linked to your identifier. We collect game information to improve our puzzle selection. If there's a certain puzzle in the "hard" category but on average users only take 3 minutes to solve it, this is clearly misplaced. 

We aim to collect as little data as possible. Information like that helps us make decisions like: "is it worth it to drop that iOS version?" and "which languages should I try to get the app translated into". Other information like the time taken to complete a particular puzzle are also collected so that the average time to complete a game and other metrics can be calculated. You can turn this off in Settings -> Analytics. 

Ashish Selvaraj developed the analytics solution in-house to minimize information collection. Prior to May 20th, 2025, the analytics service was running on Amazon Web Services and from May 20th, 2025 onwards it largely runs on Cloudflare. 

However, other websites or applications that are linked to inside the app that are not related to Not Evil Sudoku such as Apple's App Store, translation services and other independent groups may collect data including personal information and users of Not Evil Sudoku should read their privacy policies if they intend to visit or use those services.

## Third Parties
The app may link to third party websites in sections such as Settings -> Translations and Settings -> Made Possible By. Each of these websites has their own privacy policy which users should read. This privacy policy only covers the Not Evil Sudoku app.

## Identifier
The user identifier is NOT linked to any of the user's personal information. It is generated using Apple's "IdentifierForVendor" API. It helps us differentiate between users without collecting personal data. This id is common to all the apps on your device which are built by Ashish Selvaraj. More information on it is available in Apple's documentation.

Post May 20th, 2025, the identifier is no longer used, and no identifier is collected in the app, however this may change in the future.

## Changes
Ashish Selvaraj reserves the right to make changes to this policy at any time. Any changes wil be posted here in a timely manner, please review it frequently to stay up-to-date. This policy is valid from April 11, 2022 and was last updated on May 11, 2025.
